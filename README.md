## Task
We were tasked to create a dynamic webpage that allows the user to explore a blog page and add aditional blogs to a page.  We made a parady of blog sites using a tree blog website where the user can experience what a day in the life of a tree looks like.  

### Description
The user opens the website into a home page that welcomes the user to our site.  They can then explore our website through our links on the navigation bar.  They are then able to choose between making a blog or seeing all blogs.  When on the all blogs page they are able to see all blogs but also able to click on a blog to be able to pull up one singular blog.  If they go to an add blog page they can submit their own blog, choosing between a list of pregenerated tags and genres.  The author will be picked for them but they can still choose a title.  That then kicks the user back to the all blogs page where they can see their post.
